    <h2>The Twitter Files - The Removal of Donald Trump, Part One</h2>

    <p>This archive was made with Twitter's "Embed Tweet" feature. It depends for everything but the text on the Tweets that it includes still existing on Twitter. If one or more is deleted, the images will disappear. In that case, you can use the backup in <a href='removal-of-trump-part1.mhtml'>removal-of-trump-part1.mhtml</a>. That file will not open in all browsers (works for me in Brave and Chrome; does NOT work in Safari), but my browser saves it to my computer, and I have to open it from there.</p>

    <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">5. Whatever your opinion on the decision to remove Trump that day, the internal communications at Twitter between January 6th-January 8th have clear historical import.

    <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">6. As soon as they finished banning Trump, Twitter execs started processing new power. They prepared to ban future presidents and White Houses – perhaps even Joe Biden.

    <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">7. Twitter executives removed Trump in part over what one executive called the “context surrounding”: actions by Trump and supporters “over the course of the election and frankly last 4+ years.” In the end, they looked at a broad picture.

    <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">9. Before J6, Twitter was a unique mix of automated, rules-based enforcement, and more subjective moderation by senior executives. As <a href="https://twitter.com/bariweiss?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@BariWeiss</a> reported, the firm had a vast array of tools for manipulating visibility, most all of which were thrown at Trump (and others) pre-J6.</p>&mdash; Matt Taibbi (@mtaibbi) <a href="https://twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/1601358396523184129?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 9, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
    <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">10. As the election approached, senior executives – perhaps under pressure from federal agencies, with whom they met more as time progressed – increasingly struggled with rules, and began to speak of “vios” as pretexts to do what they’d likely have done anyway.</p>&mdash; Matt Taibbi (@mtaibbi) <a href="https://twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/1601358959507492864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 9, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
    <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">11. After J6, internal Slacks show Twitter executives getting a kick out of intensified relationships with federal agencies. Here’s Trust and Safety head Yoel Roth, lamenting a lack of “generic enough” calendar descriptions to concealing his “very interesting” meeting partners. <a href="https://t.co/kgC4eGykcO">pic.twitter.com/kgC4eGykcO</a></p>&mdash; Matt Taibbi (@mtaibbi) <a href="https://twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/1601359872528101376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 9, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

    <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">14. On October 8th, 2020, executives opened a channel called “us2020_xfn_enforcement.” Through J6, this would be home for discussions about election-related removals, especially ones that involved “high-profile” accounts (often called “VITs” or “Very Important Tweeters”). <a href="https://t.co/xH29h4cYt9">pic.twitter.com/xH29h4cYt9</a></p>&mdash; Matt Taibbi (@mtaibbi) <a href="https://twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/1601361141611270144?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 9, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
    <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">15.

    <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">25. The FBI-flagged tweet then got circulated in the enforcement Slack.

On December 10th, as Trump was in the middle of firing off 25 tweets saying things like, “A coup is taking place in front of our eyes,” Twitter executives announced a new “L3 deamplification” tool.
